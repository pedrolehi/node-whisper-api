1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The relationship between creatives and clients is ancient.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
From Leonardo da Vinci with the Medici family, to Frank Gehry with Bilbao and the Guggenheim.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But if there is something that has been kept intact during all these years,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is that creatives and clients don't understand each other sometimes.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But how can we reach understanding using a text that says nothing

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
into thousands of sketches that we show to our clients?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We are talking about Lorem Ipsum.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If Lorem Ipsum was used day by day in our lives, nobody could be understood.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Darling, we have to talk. It's about Lorem Ipsum.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You have the right to remain silent. All you say can be used against Lorem Ipsum.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What I feel for you is Lorem Ipsum. Sit on it.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's why the Lorem Ipsum project is born.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
An initiative which aims to turn this contentless text into a tool

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
to improve the relationship between creatives and clients.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And how does it work? Very easy.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Replace the Lorem Ipsum you usually use in your sketches for the client

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
by the manifest from the Lorem Ipsum project,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
a message of affection and respect for the work done.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Or, if you dare, create a personalized Lorem Ipsum

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
with the message you want encrypted in the original Lorem Ipsum.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Approve me this print, please. My girlfriend is getting married tomorrow

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and I expect that she does it with me.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Because when understanding is involved, nothing can prevent that a good idea goes ahead.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The Lorem Ipsum Project

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A production of LOREM IPSUM

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A production of LOREM IPSUM
